###Lexical syntax

####Comments

`::` all code following '::' on a line is a comment.

By convention, comments should begin on either column 39 or
column 57.

####Runes (Expressions)

The first glyph in a rune defines a rough semantic category of expressions:

##### ? : Conditional statements

`?&` Logical "and" 

  - Irregular: `&`

`?|` Logical "or"

  - Irregular: `|.`

`?!` Logical "not"

  - Irregular: `!`


`?:` - If-then-else

`?.` - Inverted if-then-else

`?@` - If atom-then-else

`?^` - If cell-then-else


`?-` - Switch (on type)

`?+` - Swith (on type) with default


`?>` - Assert `p` is false.

`?<` - Assert `p` is true.


`?~` - if null-then-else Note: don't forget, changes type
`?=` - is `q` of type `p`Note: don't forget, changes the type

##### % : Code execution

`%-` Call `p` with 1 arg

  - Irregular: `(p q)` Note: irregular form can accept n children.

`%.` Inverted `%-`: call `q` with arg `p`

`%+` Call `p` with 2 args

`%^` Call `p` with 3 args


`%~` Call one arm `p` within object/core `q` with arg `r`

  - Irregular: `~(p q r)`

`%*` Same as `%~` except `s` is a list of changes that can be made anywhere in
the context, not just to input data.


`%=` Evaluate `p` with changes specified in `q`

  - Irregular: `a(p q.p, q p.a)`, where `a` is the code to be executed with changes
    specified in the  `()` 

`%_` Same as `%=`, except that product is cast back to type of `p`.

##### : : Tuple construction

`:-` Tuple of two

  - Irregular `[p q ..]` Note: the irregular form can make tuples of arbitrary size

`:_` Inverted tuple of two

`:+` Tuple of three

`:^` Tuple of four


`:*` Tuple of arbitrary number of elements, closed with `==`

`:~` Null terminated tuple of arbitrary number of elements, closed with `==`.


`:/` XX

##### | : Object aka "core" construction

`|%` Generic core, closed with `--`

`|_` Core with input data (aka 'sample), closed with `--`


`|=` Function with type-checking at compile time (aka 'dry gate'); called automatically

`|*` Function with type-checking at run time (aka 'wet gate'); called automatically

`|.` Function (like `|=`) with no argument; called automatically

`|-` Function with no arguments (like `|.`); not called automatically


`|/` Same as `|_`, but with well typed output, closed with `--`

`|^` Same as `|-`, but can contain internal arms, closed with `--`

`|+` Function with unreadable argument(s) (aka 'sample'), so as to avoid type conflicts

`|?` Same as `|_` but both the input and 'context' are hidden to avoid type conflicts

##### $ : Type definitions

  - Irregular: `_p`, but only when in mold syntax

`$:` Tuple of types (aka 'molds')

  - Irregular: `{i.p i.t.p i.t.t.p}`

`$%` Tagged union

`$?` Union of types; non-empty list of types ('molds'). Default value ('bunt') is the value of the first element

  - Irregular: `?([list of molds])`, but only when in mold syntax

##### = : Subject ("context") modification XX

`=>` Resolve code; use the product of `p` as the subject of `q`

  - Irregular: `p:q`

`=|` Push default value of type ('mold') onto subject 

`=+` Push variable/value onto subject

`=-` Inverted `=+`; push product of `q` onto subject `p`


`=.` One change to subject; produce `r` with `p` in the context (in hoon the
'subject') set to `q`

`=:` Multiple changes to subject; Make a list of changes to the context (in hoon the 'subject')

  XX how do we talk about subject and context.


`=^` Used to push a new variable `q` with face `p` onto the subject `s`, as
well as to change the value of another. `r` is a function that accepts `q` and
produces a cell of a new value of `q`, and a new subject. XX

`=~` Compose a list of twigs, applying `=>` to the list, using each result as the subject to the subsequent expressions.

`=*` Make `p` an alias of `q`

##### ^ : Casting

`^|` Make core context unreadable so as to avoid type conflicts

`^.` Cast `q` to the product type of `p`. Useful when you don't actually want to run a funciton at run time

`^-` Traditional Cast `q` to the type of the default value ('bunt') of `p`

  - `\`p\`q`

`^+` Cast `q` to the type of `p`. Used to cast to types that have previously been made into validator functions with `$,`.

`^&` Convert object/core from invariant to covariant

`^~` Try to execute `p` statically at compile time. If this fails, `p` remains dynamic

`^=` Put on variable name ('face')

  - Irregular: `p=q`

`^?` Convert core with unreadable context to a core whose input ('sample') and context are unreadable. Used to avoid type conflicts

##### . : Nock operations

  - Irregular: `=(p q)`

`.?` Test if noun is cell or an atom

##### # : Pretty printing

`#<` Pretty print tape; only used in its irregular form

  - Irregular: `<i.p i.t.p i.t.t.p>`

  - Irregular: `>i.p i.t.p i.t.t.p<`

##### / : Library access

`//` Load a file between twigs

`/~` Cached computation, similar to a `=+` at the top of the file

`/$` Pull in dynamic request data, slam it through a gate

`/=` Horn form of `^=`. Puts a face on a cached computation

`/^` Horn form of `^-`

`/;` Apply gate to result of horn

`/,` Appen path to current working beam before computing horn

`/:` Replace beam

`/%` Reifiy the 'heel' virtual path, letting any requested resource interpret it further

`/.` Construct list of specified horns

`/*` similar to `/.`, but produces a map instead

`/_` descend into each available subdirectory, construct a map from all successfully building versions

`/&` Parse directory name as `@da`

`/|` Parse directory name as `@dr`

##### ~ : Compiler hints

`~$` Label computation `q` as `p` for profiling

`~|` `p` in stacktrace if `q` crashes

`~_` Preformatted stackframe `p` (a trap producing a `++tank`) into stacktrace

`~%` i.p i.t.p i.t.t.pRegister jet in core `s`

`~/` XX

`~<` Hint to product; applies arbitrary hint `p` to the product of `q`, which is computed beforehand

`~>` Arbitrary hint `p` to `q`

`~+` Memoize computation of `p`

`~&` Printf

`~=` Hint to avoid duplication

`~?` PrintF if `q` is true

`~!` Print type on compilation fail

##### ! : Special runes

`!_` Path and range in stack trace

`!>` Produces a cell of both the type and value of `p` (called a `++vase`).
Useful for debugging.

`!=` Show nock of `p`

`!?` Enforce a Hon version restriction

`!!` Crash

- Most runes have a predetermined amount of children, and thus do not need to be closed.
- Runes that accept an arbitrary number of children are typically closed with `==`.
  - Exception being the `|` runes, some of which are closed with `--`.

- Tips

  - Backstep pattern.
  - in some cases, the second glyph denotes how many 'children' a rune accepts.



Include ford runes

####Data types

#####Strings

`++tape` - List of chars. Used when you want to manipulate and interpolate text - `"[text]"`
  See [list]() section for operations.

`@t` - UTF-8 text; aka `++cord` - `'[text]'`
    `++trip`: cord to string XX
    `++taco`: cord to octet stream (for http requests) XX
    `++slav`: parse cord to an atom of input odor XX

`@ta` - Valid Hoon ASCII symbols - `~.[text]` + {`a-z`, `0-9`, `~`, `-`, `.`, `_`.}
`@tas` - Hoon identifier ASCII subset - `%` + `a-z`, `-` (not first), `1-9` (not first)

XX Would love to add half a liine about the difference between cords and tapes.

#####Numbers

`@`   - Generic atom (defaults to unsigned integer) - `42`
`@u`  - Unsigned integer - `42`
`@sd` - Signed decimal - `-42`(-), `--42` see `++si` for operations
`@rd` - Single precision floating point - `.-42.75` (-), `.42.75` (+), see `++rd` for operations

#####Other Important Atoms
`@da` - absolute date - `~~[year].[month].[date]..[hour].[minute].[second]..[fractionals]` 
      `++year`: `++date` to `@d` XX
      `++yore`: `@d` to `++date` XX
      note: year month day is mandatory, others are optional
`@dr` - relative date (timespan) - `~d[day].h[hour]m[minute].s[second]..[fractionals]`
      note: every measurement optional.
      `++add`: can add `@dr`s together XX
      `++yell`: `@d` to `++tarp`       XX
`@p` - phonemic base - `~[valid @p]`
      `(scot %p [number])` prints a number as a `@p`

#####Data structures

######Tuples are made with the `:` runes and their irregular `[]` wide forms

 To construct, use [`[]`]() (irregular form of [`:` runes]()).

`[3 'hello']`

Special syntaxes:

`~[1 2 3]` > `[1 2 3 ~]`

`[1 2 3]~` > `[[1 2 3] ~]`

`~[1 2 3]~` > `[[1 2 3 ~] ~]`

######Autocons

To eliminate need for excess `[]`, tuples automatically group to
the right:

`[1 [2 [3 ~]]]` == `[1 2 3 ~]`

######pair, trel, quad put faces on tuples

``=+ a=`(pair term cord)`[%h 'j']`` >  `[p=%h q='j']`

Faces allow you to access specific axes within your context: 

`p.a` > `%h` and `p:[p=%h q='j']` > `%h`

######Lists are null-terminated and have faces of `i` and `t`

`++limo` makes a list out of a null terminated tuple.
`(limo [67 55 201 ~])` > `[i=67 t=[i=55 t=[i=201 t=~]]]`

``` `(list ,@t)``(list ,@)`~[67 55] ``` >  `<|C 7|>`

Functions:

`++weld`: concatenate
`++scag`: slice up to (and including) index number args: (index, list)
`++slag`: slice list after index, args: (index, list)
`++turn`: map over list, args: (list, function)
`++reel`: right fold args: (list, function)
`++roll`: left fold args: (list, function)
`++sort`: quicksort, args: (list, comparator-function)

######Map

######Set

#####Addressing within nouns

XXincomplete

There are several ways you can address an axes of a noun:

1. If it has a face: `[face].[noun]`
2. `.face.+..`
3. +>-<
4. |[number]
5. &[number]
