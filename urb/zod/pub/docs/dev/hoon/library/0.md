volume 0, Kelvin Versioning.
===========================

### `++hoon`

Hoon version number Kelvin

Traditional software versioning schema use fractions, and count up. Thus, they
can keep extending and revising their systems incrementally. This is generally
considered a good thing, and it generally is.

In some cases, however, specifications needs to be permanently frozen.
This requirement is generally found in the context of standards. Some
standards are extensible or versionable, but some are not. ASCII, for
instance, is perma-frozen. So is IPv4 (its relationship to IPv6 is
little more than nominal - if they were really the same protocol, they'd
have the same ethertype). Moreover, many standards render themselves
incompatible in practice through excessive enthusiasm for extensibility.
They may not be perma-frozen, but they probably should be.

As urbit is designed to be a standard, we devised a versioning scheme that will
allow it to eventually be frozen: Kelvin versioning. In Kelvin versioning,
releases count down by integer degrees Kelvin. At absolute zero, the system can
no longer be changed. At 1K, one more modification is possible. And so on. For
instance, Nock is at 5K. It might change, though it probably won't. Nouns
themselves are at 0K - it is impossible to imagine changing anything about
their three sentence definition.
