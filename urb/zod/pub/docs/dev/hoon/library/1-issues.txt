Big, general issues

  1. Should we put in a 'composed of' section?

  2. Do we need the 'see also section?' Check that everything is in
  line for this.

  3. If so, look at the git history and review all the ones you
  previously deleted.

IV. Specific issues

  1. Don't understand how to explain qual, trel, pair, w/regard
  to using mold/type

  2. We need to explain with a %palm inside tank is. 

  3. Currently no explanations for mold, twig, and type. They
  have links to their own particular sections, which I don't
  think yet exist. How should we handle this?

  4. I think vase merits more of an explanation due to its
  importance.

  5. The line between examples
