We've dealt fairly extensively with "poke" messages to an app,
but these are somewhat limited.  A poke is a one-way message, but
more often we want to subscribe to updates from another app.  You
could build a subscription model out of one-way pokes, but it's
such a common pattern that it's built into arvo.

Let's take a look at two apps, `:source` and `:sink`.  First,
`:source`:

```
/?    314
!:
|%
++  move  ,[bone %diff mark *]
--
|_  [hid=bowl state=~]
++  poke-noun
  |=  arg=*
  ^-  [(list move) _+>.$]
  :_  +>.$
  %+  turn  (prey /the-path hid)
  |=([o=bone *] [o %diff %noun arg])
++  peer
  |=  pax=path
  ^-  [(list move) _+>.$]
  ~&  [%subscribed-to pax=pax]
  [~ +>.$]
--
```

And secondly, `:sink`:

```
/?    314
|%
++  move  ,[bone card]
++  card
  $%  [%peer wire [@p term] path]
      [%pull wire [@p term] ~]
  ==
--
!:
|_  [bowl available=?]
++  poke-noun
  |=  arg=*
  ^-  [(list move) _+>.$]
  ?:  &(=(%on arg) available)
    [[[ost %peer /subscribe [our %source] /the-path] ~] +>.$(available |)]
  ?:  &(=(%off arg) !available)
    [[[ost %pull /subscribe [our %source] ~] ~] +>.$(available &)]
  ~&  ?:(available %not-subscribed %subscribed)
  [~ +>.$]
++  diff-noun
  |=  [wir=wire arg=*]
  ^-  [(list move) _+>.$]
  ~&  [%recieved-data arg]
  [~ +>.$]
++  reap
  |=  [wir=wire error=(unit tang)]
  ^-  [(list move) _+>.$]
  ?~  error
    ~&  %successfully-subscribed
    [~ +>.$]
  ~&  [%subscription-failed error]
  [~ +>.$]
--
```

Cheat sheet:

```
- `&` can either be the boolean true (along with `%.y`, `0`), or the irregular wide form
  of the `$&` rune, which computes the logical 'and' operation on its two
  children.

- Similar to `&`,`|` is either the boolean false (along with `%.n` and `1`), or
  the irregular short for of `?|`, which computes the logical 'or' operation on
  its two children

- `!` is the irregular wide form of `?!`, which computes the logical `not` on
  its child. 

- `?~` is basically an if-then-else statement that checks whether condition `p`
  is `~` (null). `?~` is slightly different to `?:(~ %tru %fal) in that it
  reduces to ?:($=(%type value) %tru %false). `$=` tests whether value `q`
  falls within type `p`. One thing to watch out for in hoon: if you do `?~`, it
  affects the type of the conditional value: XXexample

- `:_` is just an inverted `:-`: all it does is accept children `p` and `q` and
  produce an inverted tuple of the two, `[q p]`.

-  `++bowl` is the type of our system state within our app. For example, it
   includes things like `our`, the ship name of the host, and  `now`, the
   current time. 

-  `$%` is a type constructor that defines a type composed of `n`
   types that it is passed. For example `$%  @  *  ^  ==` is the
   type of either `@`, `*`, or a cell `^`.

-  You may have noticed the separate `|%` above the application
   core `|_`. We usually put our types in another core on top of the
   application core. We can do this because hoon.hoon files, all
   cores are =>'ed (called) against each other. Thus the `|%`
   with the types is in the context of the `|_`, as it lies above
   it.

Here's some sample output of the two working together:

```

>=
~fintud-macrep:dojo> |start %sink

~fintud-macrep:dojo> :sink %on

~fintud-macrep:dojo> :source 5

~fintud-macrep:dojo> :sink %off
>=
~fintud-macrep:dojo> :source 6

~fintud-macrep:dojo> :sink %on
[%subscribed-to pax=/the-path]
%successfully-subscribed]

~fintud-macrep:dojo> :source 7

```

###:source

Hopefully you can get a sense for what's happening here.  When we
poke `:sink` with `%on`, `:sink` subscribes to `:source`, and so
whenever we poke `:source`, `:sink` gets the update and prints it
out.  Then we unsubscribe by poking `:sink` with `%off`, and
`:sink` stops getting updates.  We then resubscribe.

There's a fair bit going on in this code,  Let's look at
`:source` first.

Our definition of `move` is fairly specific, since we're only
going to sending one kind of move.  The `%diff` move is a
subscription update, and its content is marked data which gall
routes to our subscribers.

This is a slightly different kind of move than we've dealt with
so far.  It's producing a result rather than calling other code
(i.e. it's a return rather than a function call), so if you
recall the discussion of ducts, a layer gets popped off the duct
rather than added to it.  This is why no wire is needed for the
move -- we won't receive anything in response to it.

Anyways, there're two functions inside the `|_`.  We already know
when `++poke-noun` is called.  `++peer` is called when someone
tries to subscribe to our app.  Of course, you don't just
subscribe to an app; you subscribe to a path on that app.  This
path comes in as the argument to `++peer`.

In our case, we don't care what path you subscribed on, and all
we do is print out that you subscribed.  Arvo keeps track of your
subscriptions, so you don't have to.  You can access your
subscribers by looking at `sup` in the bowl that's passed in.
`sup` is of type `(map bone ,[@p path])`, which associates bones
with the urbit who subscribed, and which path they subscribed on.
If you want to talk to your subscribers, send them messages along
their bone.

`++poke-noun` spams the given arguement to all our subscribers.
There's a few things we haven't seen before.  Firstly, `:_(a b)`
is the same as `[b a]`.  It's just a convenient way of formatting
things when the first thing in a cell is much more complicated
than the second.  Thus, we're producing our state unchanged.

Our list of moves is the result of a call to `++turn`.  `++turn`
is what many languages call "map" -- it runs a function on every
item in a list and collects the results in a list.  The list is
`(prey /the-path hid)` and the function is the `|=` line right
after it.

`++prey` is a standard library function defined in `zuse`.  It
takes a path and a bowl and gives you a list of the subscribers
who are subscribed on a path that begins with the given path.
"Prey" is short for "prefix".

Now we have the list of relevant subscribers.  This a list of
triples, `[bone @p path]`, where the only thing we really need is
the bone because we don't care what urbit they are or what exact
path they subscribed on.  Thus, our transformer function takes
`[o=bone *]` and produces `[o %diff %noun arg]`, which is a move
that means "tell bone `o` this subscription update:  `[%noun
arg]`".  This is fairly dense code, but what it's doing is
straightforward.

###:sink

`:source` should now make sense.  `:sink` is a little longer,
but not much more complicated.

In `:sink`, our definition of of `++move` is different.  All
moves start with a `bone`, and we conventionally refer to the
second half as the "card", so that we can say a move is an action
that sends a card along a bone.

We have two kinds of cards here:  we `%peer` to start a
subscription, and we `%pull` to stop it.  Both of these are
"forward" moves that may receive a response, so they need a wire
to tack onto the duct before they pass it on.  They also need a
target, which is a pair of an urbit and an app name. Additionally, `%peer`
needs a path on that app to subscribe too.  `%pull` doesn't need
this, because its semantics are to cancel any subscriptions
coming over this duct.  If your bone and wire are the same as
when you subscribed, then the cancellation will happen correctly.

The only state we need for `:sink` is a loobean to tell whether
we're already subscribed to `:source`.  We use `available=?`,
where `?` is the sign of type boolean (similar to `*`, `@`) (which defaults to true).

In `++poke-noun` we check our input to see both if it's `%on` and
we're available.  If so, we produce the move to subscribe to
`:source`:

```
[ost %peer /subscribe [our %source] /the-path]
```

Also, we set available to false (`|`) with `+>.$(available |)`.

Otherwise, if our input is `%off` and we're already subscribed
(i.e. `available` is false), then we unsubscribe from
`:source`:

```
[ost %pull /subscribe [our %source] ~]
```

It's important to send over the same bone and wire (`/subscribe`)
as the one we originally subscribed on.

We also set `available` to true (`&`).

If neither of these cases are true, then we just print out our
current subscription state and do nothing.

`++diff-noun` is called when we get a `%diff` update along a
subscription with a mark of `noun`.  `++diff-noun` is given the
wire that we originally passed with the `%peer` subscription
request along and the data we got back.  In our case we just
print out the data.

`++reap` is called when we receive an acknowledgment as to
whether the subscription was handled successfully. You can
remember that `++reap` is the counterpart to `++peer` as it's
almost spelled the same as 'peer' backwards. Similarly, `coup` is
similar to 'poke' backwards.

Moving forward, `++reap` is given the wire we attempted to
subscribe over, possibly along with an error message in cases of
failure. `(unit type)` means "either `~` or `[~ type]`, which
means it's used like Haskell's "maybe" or C's nullability.  If
`error` is `~`, then the subscription was successful, so we tell
that to the user.  Otherwise, we print out the error message.
